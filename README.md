# BugTracker
This is the light version of bug tracker, that have:
  1) Ability to create <b>Projects</b> with different types (Fullstack, Front-end and Back-end);
  2) Ability to create <b>Issues</b> related to one of your projects;
  3) Ability to keep track the progress of your work on issues and projects in general.

Right now this project is still being developed.

<b>Completed</b>:
  1) All HTML templates, style (CSS, Bootstrap) and required JS;
  2) Temporary SQLite database with Django Models and URLconf;
  3) All HTML (except all forms + modals from Bootstrap) is filled with information from database.

<b>Need to do</b>:
  1) Fill out all HTML forms and Bootstrap modals via Django forms;
  2) Add ability to register and login;
  3) Change db to SQL (after complete a fully working app);
  4) Fix current bugs and future ones (if they are, AND THEY WILL).
